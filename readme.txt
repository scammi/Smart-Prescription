#SmartPrescriptions

We are trying to achive a simple bare bone program, that uses a sudo address to create erc721 tokens
this token will emulate prescriptions and will have their own logic.

there are 3 main players and a cordinator (goberment) or sudo for now. The other 3 players are
the doctor, the patient and the pharmacies. Every each one will have different permissions.

First all methods and variables will be created and the sudo account will be used to test, later
every party will be delegated it's function by permissions.

Main methods.
  -create structs
  -view method (get)
Main variables
  -struct for prescriptions
  -an dynamic array to store
